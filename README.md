# AdWords-Placement-Problem-via-Online-Bipartite-Graph-Matching
Given a set of advertisers each of whom has a daily budget 𝐵𝑖 and when a user performs a query, an ad request is placed online and a group of advertisers can then bid for that advertisement slot

# Technology
• Python

# Techniques
• Bipartite Graph Matching (Greedy, MSVV and Balance algorithms)

# Assumptions
1. For the optimal matching (used for calculating the competitive ratio), we will assume everyone’s budget is completely used.
2. The bid values are fixed (unlike in the real world where advertisers normally compete by incrementing their bid by 1 cent).
3. Each ad request has just one advertisement slot to display.
